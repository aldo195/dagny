12217,,5,Medium,10.10.10.123,udp,53,DNS Server Cache Snooping Remote Information Disclosure,The remote DNS server is vulnerable to cache snooping attacks.,"The remote DNS server responds to queries for third-party domains
that do not have the recursion bit set. 

This may allow a remote attacker to determine which domains have
recently been resolved via this name server, and therefore which hosts
have been recently visited. 

For instance, if an attacker was interested in whether your company
utilizes the online services of a particular financial institution,
they would be able to use this attack to build a statistical model
regarding company usage of that financial institution.  Of course, the
attack can also be used to find B2B partners, web-surfing patterns,
external mail servers, and more.

Note: If this is an internal DNS server not accessible to outside
networks, attacks would be limited to the internal network. This
may include employees, consultants and potentially users on

51192,,6.4,Medium,10.10.10.123,tcp,3389,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.,"http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

in one or more cipher suites. It is, therefore, affected by a
vulnerability, known as SWEET32, due to the use of weak 64-bit block
ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker who has sufficient resources can
exploit this vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret and a known
plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the secret text, such as secure
HTTPS cookies, and possibly resulting in the hijacking of an
authenticated session.

Proof-of-concepts have shown that attackers can recover authentication
cookies from an HTTPS session in as little as 30 hours.

Note that the ability to send a large number of requests over the
same TLS connection between the client and server is an important
requirement for carrying out this attack. If the number of requests
allowed for a single connection were limited, this would mitigate the
vulnerability. However, Nessus has not checked for such a mitigation.","Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of all
