SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4 to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that the there is a stronger bias in RC4, which make statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples, that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach.

The Duration is the period of time it takes the service to perform a scan task. The Duration includes the time it takes the service to scan all hosts, which may involve parallel scanning. It also includes the time it takes for a scanner appliance to pick up the scan task and transfer the results back to the service's Secure Operating Center. Further, when a scan task is distributed across multiple scanners, the Duration includes the time it takes to perform parallel host scanning on all scanners.

They provide these services by using encryption for privacy, x509 certificates for authenticity and one-way hash functions for integrity. To encrypt data SSL and TLS can use block ciphers, which are encryption algorithms that can encrypt only a fixed block of original data to an encrypted block of the same size. Note that these ciphers will always obtain the same resulting block for the same original block of data. To achieve difference in the output the output of encryption is XORed with yet another block of the same size referred to as initialization vectors (IV). A special mode of operation for block ciphers known as CBC (cipher block chaining) uses one IV for the initial block and the result of the previous block for each subsequent block to obtain difference in the output of block cipher encryption.
 
In SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 implementation the choice CBC mode usage was poor because the entire traffic shares one CBC session with single set of initial IVs. The rest of the IV are as mentioned above results of the encryption of the previous blocks. The subsequent IV are available to the eavesdroppers. This allows an attacker with the capability to inject arbitrary traffic into the plain-text stream (to be encrypted by the client) to verify their guess of the plain-text preceding the injected block. If the attackers guess is correct then the output of the encryption will be the same for two blocks.
 For low entropy data it is possible to guess the plain-text block with relatively few number of attempts. For example for data that has 1000 possibilities the number of attempts can be 500.

 NOTE: 
The CVSS access complexity assigned by NIST to CVE-2011-3389 is 'Medium' which makes the base score 4.3. But Qualys has assigned access complexity to 'High' for server side, because Javascipt injection and MiTM capabilities and a vulnerable client are required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore the Qualys CVSS score is 2.6.",Recently attacks against the web authentication cookies have been described which used this vulnerability. If the authentication cookie is guessed by the attacker then the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user on the Web site which accepts the authentication cookie.,"This attack was identified in 2004 and later revisions of TLS protocol which contain a fix for this. If possible, upgrade to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. If upgrading to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 is not possible, then disabling CBC mode ciphers will remove the vulnerability.
 
Setting your SSL server to prioritize RC4 ciphers mitigates this vulnerability. Microsoft has posted information including workarounds for IIS at KB2588513 (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2588513).
 
Using the following SSL configuration in Apache mitigates this vulnerability:

When SMB signing is enabled on both the client and server SMB sessions are authenticated between the machines on a packet by packet basis.","Unauthorized users sniffing the network could catch many challenge/response exchanges and replay the whole thing to grab particular session keys, and then authenticate on the Domain Controller.","Without SMB signing, a device could intercept SMB network packets from an originating computer, alter their contents, and broadcast them to the destination computer. Since, digitally signing the packets enables the recipient of the packets to confirm their point of origination and their authenticity, it is recommended that SMB signing is enabled and required.
 
Please refer to Microsoft's article 887429 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887429) for information on enabling SMB signing. 
 
For Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, please refer to Microsoft's article Require SMB Security Signatures (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731957.aspx) for information on enabling SMB signing.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

Per this paper (http://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-11/dc-11-presentations/dc-11-Roelker/dc-11-roelker-paper.pdf) by Daniel Roelker that was presented at Defcon 11, popular Web servers like Microsoft IIS support a variety of encoding schemes for the URLs. These include Percent-escaped Hex Encoding, Double-percent Escaped Hex Encoding, Microsoft's %U Encoding, Percent-escaped 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding, and Raw 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding.
 
For a sample HTTP GET request, GET /. HTTP/1.0, the following illustrates the encoded URI under these schemes: 
 
Percent-escaped Hex Encoding: GET /%2e HTTP/1.0
Double-percent Escaped Hex Encoding: GET /%252e HTTP/1.0
Percent-escaped 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding: GET /%C0%AE HTTP/1.0
Raw 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding: GET /\xC0\xAE HTTP/1.0 (Actual raw 0xC0 and 0xAE bytes)
Microsoft's %U Encoding: GET /%u002e HTTP/1.0
 
 
The supported encoding schemes are listed in the Results section.

Windows systems by default have the administrator account's name configured as ""Administrator"". This can very easily be changed to a non-default value (like root, for example) to harden security against password bruteforcing.

The Host Scan Time does not have a direct correlation to the Duration time as displayed in the Report Summary section of a scan results report. The Duration is the period of time it takes the service to perform a scan task. The Duration includes the time it takes the service to scan all hosts, which may involve parallel scanning. It also includes the time it takes for a scanner appliance to pick up the scan task and transfer the results back to the service's Secure Operating Center. Further, when a scan task is distributed across multiple scanners, the Duration includes the time it takes to perform parallel host scanning on all scanners.

SSL session caching is targeted to reduce the overhead of negotiations in recurring SSL connections. SSL sessions can be reused to resume an earlier connection or to establish multiple simultaneous connections. The client suggests an SSL session to be reused by identifying the session with a Session-ID during SSL handshake. If the server finds it appropriate to reuse the session,  then they both proceed to secure communication with already known security parameters.
 
This test determines if SSL session caching is enabled on the host.",SSL session caching is part of the SSL and TLS protocols and is not a security threat.

The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data.

For example if TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. 
RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security. 

A POODLE-type (https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2014/12/08/poodle-bites-tls) attack could also be launched directly at TLS without negotiating a downgrade. 

  This QID will be marked as a Fail for PCI as of May 1st, 2017 in accordance with the new standards.  For existing implementations, Merchants will be able to submit a PCI False Positive / Exception Request and provide proof of their Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan, which will result in a pass for PCI up until June 30th, 2018.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Content-Security-Policy: This HTTP header helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS), packet sniffing attacks and data injection attacks. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors - This directive specifies valid parents that may embed a page using frame, iframe, object, embed, or applet
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection HTTP: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid directive for Content-Security-Policy, except for Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks.","CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), Content Security Policy (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) HTTP response headers.

SMB signing is a security mechanism in the SMB protocol and is also known as security signatures. SMB signing is designed to help improve the security of the SMB protocol.
 
SMB signing adds security to a network using NetBIOS, avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
When SMB signing is enabled on both the client and server SMB sessions are authenticated between the machines on a packet by packet basis.","Unauthorized users sniffing the network could catch many challenge/response exchanges and replay the whole thing to grab particular session keys, and then authenticate on the Domain Controller.","Without SMB signing, a device could intercept SMB network packets from an originating computer, alter their contents, and broadcast them to the destination computer. Since, digitally signing the packets enables the recipient of the packets to confirm their point of origination and their authenticity, it is recommended that SMB signing is enabled and required.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.",Not  applicable.,Not  applicable.,,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

Per this paper (http://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-11/dc-11-presentations/dc-11-Roelker/dc-11-roelker-paper.pdf) by Daniel Roelker that was presented at Defcon 11, popular Web servers like Microsoft IIS support a variety of encoding schemes for the URLs. These include Percent-escaped Hex Encoding, Double-percent Escaped Hex Encoding, Microsoft's %U Encoding, Percent-escaped 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding, and Raw 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding.
 
For a sample HTTP GET request, GET /. HTTP/1.0, the following illustrates the encoded URI under these schemes: 
 
Percent-escaped Hex Encoding: GET /%2e HTTP/1.0
Double-percent Escaped Hex Encoding: GET /%252e HTTP/1.0
Percent-escaped 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding: GET /%C0%AE HTTP/1.0
Raw 2-Byte UTF-8 Encoding: GET /\xC0\xAE HTTP/1.0 (Actual raw 0xC0 and 0xAE bytes)
Microsoft's %U Encoding: GET /%u002e HTTP/1.0
 
 
The supported encoding schemes are listed in the Results section.

LSA, internally, refers to user accounts by what are called RIDs (Relative IDs) instead of the friendlier names (like ""Administrator"") used only for GUI and display purposes. The administrator account on any Windows system always has a RID of 500, even if the name has been changed.

The Duration is the period of time it takes the service to perform a scan task. The Duration includes the time it takes the service to scan all hosts, which may involve parallel scanning. It also includes the time it takes for a scanner appliance to pick up the scan task and transfer the results back to the service's Secure Operating Center. Further, when a scan task is distributed across multiple scanners, the Duration includes the time it takes to perform parallel host scanning on all scanners.

Note that if the host is behind a firewall, there is a small chance that the list includes a few ports that are filtered or blocked by the firewall but are not actually open on the target host. This (false positive on UDP open ports) may happen when the firewall is configured to reject UDP packets for most (but not all) ports with an ICMP Port Unreachable packet. This may also happen when the firewall is configured to allow UDP packets for most (but not all) ports through and filter/block/drop UDP packets for only a few ports.
